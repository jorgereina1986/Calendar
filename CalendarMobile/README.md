# Sample Calendar App

#### Very Important Note
Please press the refresh button once or twice if connection times out at first. I have a free tier
Heroku application with only one dyno. After one hour of inactivity, my backend will go to sleep. 
Therefore, in order to "wake" it up again, the first and/or second request will have a delay.

## Description
This is a sample calendar app that has only the month of February hard-coded. You can create, edit,
and delete events. All changes are uploaded to the backend server. 

## Endpoint
```https://spotical.herokuapp.com/events```

Backend was built using Node.js, Express, Mongoose and Heroku with the help of the **[rest][1]** library
